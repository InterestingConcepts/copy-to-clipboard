We represent artist and author Joe Taveras, whose new hardcover release, meditations, is an invitation to explore art, consciousness, and self-exploration through a unique fusion of American Futurism and philosophy. Given East West Bookshop's dedication to spiritual and philosophical literature, we believe meditations would be a compelling addition to your curated selection. meditations (144 pages, 8.5"x8.5") is a visually captivating book that combines a series of Taveras' artworks with accompanying text. The volume delves into themes such as quantum physics, mythology, and self-discovery, which we feel resonate with the interests of your audience. Each artwork is documented within the atmospheric setting of The Atelier, Taveras' Summer studio—a nearly-abandoned space that served as a vessel for his creative journey. Printed on premium 80lb gloss paper stock and bound in a matte hardcover, the book offers an immersive reading and viewing experience that aligns with East West's focus on conscious and meaningful literature. Would you be open to reviewing a copy of meditations for possible inclusion in your Mountain View and Seattle locations? I would be more than happy to provide any additional information or coordinate a call to discuss this opportunity further. Thank you for considering meditations. We truly admire the role East West Bookshop plays in cultivating a space for self-exploration and consciousness, and we feel this volume could enrich your offerings. Warm regards, Jessica Mouawad JM Vision Strategy on behalf of Interesting Concepts Publishing &lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;button onclick="copyText()"&gt;Copy to Clipboard&lt;/button&gt; &lt;script&gt; function copyText() { const textArea = document.getElementById("textToCopy"); textArea.select(); document.execCommand("copy"); alert("Text copied to clipboard!"); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</span></p>
